# A brief TOC

The corresponding OSF repository is [here](https://osf.io/zy92w/), and contains data to reproduce these analyses. Please contact me if you require any assistance.

- _bw-wi_correlations_ contains code and an html report for the correlations among the primary predictors of tfMRI during emotion viewing.
- _reliability_ contains code for the temporal and spatial consistency analyses. Please note that the spatial consistency code also includes options for fitting models of the association between the predictors, above, and parcel-level data.
- _voxel-wise_group-level_ contains code for estimating voxel-wise models of associations between the tfMRI data and predictors.
